<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
inBestmentPortfolio is a FinTech project aimed at defining the best investment portfolio by combining to a variable extent a given set of finacial indices, over a predefined time horizon.

## Solution strategy
The high-level solution strategy adopted consists in optimizing a trade-off between the estimated stock returns and the risk associated with a combination of the stock indices. This is accomplished by exploiting, among the others:
- ARIMA (GEP Box et al., [1976](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?&title=Time%20series%20analysis%3A%20forecasting%20and%20control&publication_year=1976&author=Box%2CGEP&author=Jenkins%2CGM&author=Reinsel%2CGC)) model, with some experiments ARIMA in rolling window mode along with some decision tree and bagging -based regressors, leveraging gread-search for hyperparameterâ€™s tuning, for returns estimation;
- both the Volatility Weighted Historical Simulation (John Hull et al., [1998](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John-Hull-6/publication/2645882_Incorporating_volatility_updating_into_the_historical_simulation_method_for_VaR/links/00b7d5335d8e2394d0000000/Incorporating-volatility-updating-into-the-historical-simulation-method-for-VaR.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone&origin=journalDetail&_rtd=e30%3D)) and the Filtered Historical Simulation (Barone-Adesi et al., [1998](http://filteredhistoricalsimulation.com/downloads/paws_feb98.pdf)) approaches, for risk estimation;
- GARCH [1986](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/030440769290064X)) model, for conditional variance estimation, to support risk estimation;
- the Differential Algorithm (Rainer Storn et al., [1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/a:1008202821328)) metaheuristic and the PSO (James Kennedy et al., [1995](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/488968/)) genetic algorithm, for returns-risk trade-off optimization.
